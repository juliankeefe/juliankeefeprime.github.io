                Hello PrimeAcademy! My name is Julian Keefe, and I am a current business/design/ tech hybrid looking to make the leap into 
                full time development. I have experience in UX/ UI design, became involved in my univiersity's startup ecosysystem, and currently
                work at a top Salesforce implementation firm helping companies move their IT infrastructure to the cloud. My ultimate dream in learning
                to code is to be able to bring my side-projects from wireframes to fully functional web applications, and work at a company or startup
                that I believe in the mission and team.
            </p>
